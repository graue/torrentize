Unimplemented:
 * -i, ignoring files matching certain wildcards

Limitations:
 * doesn't work on big endian systems yet
 * with multi-tracker, only one tracker can be placed in each tier
 * skips over files that are symbolic links

To add:
 * -c comment: add comment
 * -C file: add comment from file
 * sha1sum for files

Bug:
 * Doesn't work correctly if you use a directory of "." for torrentizing.
 * Doesn't work correctly if filesystem encoding is not UTF-8 (no conversion).
